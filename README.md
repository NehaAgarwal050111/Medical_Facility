# Medical_Facility

# Introduction
  
Our Project Idea is to find out about medical facility in a particular city or region. So its a kind of a survey to find out any medical center in an area which can either help to establish a new one or can help to find one in a given radius of a particular location.


# Data Section

 we are trying to find out geolocation of a medical centre of a particular region or city. We will fetch the data from foursquare API.

Here are the keys of the project:

1. Number of medical centers in a given radius.

2. What are the facilities that a medical center provides.

3. Exact geolocation with full address of medical center.
